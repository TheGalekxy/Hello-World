        <h2> Introduction </h2>
          <p> Hi, I'm Adam!
            This is the beginning of my journey into programming and Github! <br>
            My goal is to become a Front-End Web Developer by my next birthday (March 2020) and I won't stop at anything until I make that dream a reality! <br>
            The road is going to be a tough one, I predict many long days of work and research to make this a reality.<br>
            Since my goal is to become a Front-End Web Developer (For now) I have decided to focus on a few programming languages that are necessary for this role.<br>
            These languages include; Html, Css, Javascript, and Sql so expect to see code in those languages being uploaded to my Github.
        </p>

<!---Noticed there is a lag rendering the photo which gives a glimpse of the text, wonder if this can be fixed or if it's just because the resources are internal. --->
