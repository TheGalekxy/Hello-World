        <h2> Introduction </h2>
          <p> Hi, I'm Adam!
            This is the beginning of my journey into programming and Github! <br>
            My goal is to become a Front-End Web Developer by my next birthday (March 2020) and I won't stop at anything until I make that dream a reality! <br>
            The road is going to be a tough one, I predict many long days of work and research to make this a reality.<br>
            Since my goal is to become a Front-End Web Developer (For now) I have decided to focus on a few programming languages that are necessary for this role.<br>
            These languages include; Html, Css, Javascript, and Sql so expect to see code in those languages being uploaded to my Github.
        </p>

        <h2> My Work </h2>      <!---ultimately I'd like the "My Work" header to have a hyperlink to a location on the page...but I need work to display XD --->
          <h4> Tribute Page </h4>
            <!--- Would like to add photo's to my tribute page --->
            <p> This is a tribute page created for the FreeCodeCamp Web design certificate. <br>
              One of the biggest issues I faced when completing this project was figuring out how to make the initial size of the photo (which was massive) smaller while also allowing it to resize based on the size of the device. <br>
              To fix this, I simply set a 'max-width' and 'max-height' that I thought was reasonable to make sure that the photo would not become bigger than that size.
            </p>

<!---Noticed there is a lag rendering the photo which gives a glimpse of the text, wonder if this can be fixed or if it's just because the resources are internal. --->
