    <img src="C:\Users\Adam\Website Resources\Photos to use on website/AdamGalek.jpg" alt="A picture of Adam Galek" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/> <!--- Using some CSS here that I googled because I couldn't figure out how to center the image I had. Something to look into for the future; I don't have enough time today. --->
    <h4 style="text-align:center"> Aspiring Front End Developer </h4>
    <h2 style="text-align:center"> Introduction </h2>
      <p style="text-align:center"> Hi, I'm Adam!               <!--- Right now I am using "text-align:center" for everything, I am positive there is a better way to do this. Likely have to group up the whole section of text I wrote, then style them all as a group. Would be way more efficient...I'll get there. Maybe CSS will help with this. --->
      This is the beginning of my journey into programming and Github! <br>
      My goal is to become a Front-End Web Developer by my next birthday (March 2020) and I won't stop at anything until I make that dream a reality! <br>
      The road is going to be a tough one, I predict many long days of work and research to make this a reality.<br>
      Since my goal is to become a Front-End Web Developer (For now) I have decided to focus on a few programming languages that are necessary for this role.<br>
      These languages include; Html, Css, Javascript, and Sql so expect to see code in those languages being uploaded to my Github.
