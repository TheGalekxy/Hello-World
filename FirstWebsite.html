    <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <p> Hi, I'm Adam!
      This is the beginning of my journey into programming and Github!
      My goal is to become a Front-End Web Developer by my next birthday (March 2020) and I won't stop at anything until I make that dream a reality!
      The road is going to be a tough one, I predict many long days of work and research to make this a reality.
      Since my goal is to become a Front-End Web Developer (For now) I have decided to focus on a few programming languages that are necessary for this role.
      These languages include; Html, Css, Javascript, and Sql so expect to see code in those languages being uploaded to my Github.
